# Module solver implementation guide

The canonical guide for implementing a new module solver (backend and frontend) is in the project root:

**[../../docs/implementing-new-module-solver.md](../../docs/implementing-new-module-solver.md)**

It covers both the Java backend and the TypeScript/React frontend in one place to avoid duplication and drift.
